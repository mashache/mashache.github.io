I am a third-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on the documentation and description of languages. I am also interested in linguistic typology and the role of language contact in shaping grammar. I conducted field research working on several Uralic languages of Russia. Currently, I am working on documenting and describing Yagua (Peba-Yaguan), a language of the Peruvian Amazon.
